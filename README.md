## Description

This project is a final take home challenge, completed in under 8 hours, which demonstrates knowledge of React, Context API, Typescript, Javascript, and CSS. This presented an opportunity to work with mobile-friendly responsive design, and showcase what I've learned through Turing these past months.

I focused on error handling, and showed aptitude for clean design principles, providing a simple, functional UI/UX that is clear at all points of the application.
